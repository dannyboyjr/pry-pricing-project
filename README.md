Screen shots of my pricing page below. This was built in React and has a slider bar. If customers spent under $75k a month, Pry was $50. If it was over $75k, Pry started at $150 per month but became a variable cost after their spend surpassed $150k a month. I could easily slide the bar to their spend so they could quickly see what the cost of Pry would be. Feel free to download the project, run `npm install` and then `npm start` to check it out for yourself!
